List technologies used to build tic tac toe I used:
- html
- css 
- js with DOM


# user stories:

player 1, by defult click on squre to add X

player 2, by defult click on squre to add O

player 2 will play with 'X'

player can play again if he/she clicked on Replay button

player can turn music if he/she clicked on (music on) button



### develpment process

* i wrote html and css code then js code

* i defined a variable call player to player turn and switching between player 1 & 2 and two variables for character 'X' and 'O'

* I used DOM for click event

* I created methode call winnerpleyr to looking for winner in each time the user add on squre to find the winner


# List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations:
* counting the winning in playing with computer case.
* player choose the Mark "X" or "O" then start Game.
